# Fragment Information: 
Each metadata entry should specify the fragment's position, size, and unique identifier. This information is crucial for reassembling the file correctly. You might include attributes like fragment_id, fragment_index, and fragment_size.

# File Identifier: 
Include a unique identifier for the complete file. This identifier should be consistent across all fragments of the same file. It helps nodes in the P2P network identify and group fragments belonging to the same file.

# Checksum or Hash: 
Include a checksum or hash of the fragment data. This can be useful for integrity checks during reassembly. It ensures that the fragment data hasn't been tampered with during transmission.

# Timestamp: 
Include a timestamp indicating when the fragment was created or added to the network. This can be helpful for tracking the sequence of fragments and managing versioning if needed.

# Sender Information: 
Depending on your use case, you might want to include information about the node that originally added the fragment to the network. This could include the node's unique identifier or IP address.

# Fragment Ordering Information: 
If fragments need to be reassembled in a specific order, include attributes to indicate the correct order, such as previous_fragment_id or next_fragment_id.
